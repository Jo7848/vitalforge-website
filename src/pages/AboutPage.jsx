            My name is Josh, and my fitness journey started back in high school â€” not as a coach, but as the chubby kid who didnâ€™t feel good in his own body. I still remember the first time I stepped into a gym. I wasnâ€™t chasing muscles or aesthetics; I just wanted to feel better about myself.

            But something happened â€” I fell in love with it.

            With every rep and routine, I became more curious about the human body â€” its design, its limits, and its unrealized potential. That curiosity evolved into a calling, and I knew I had to pursue it fully. So I enrolled in university and earned a degree in Exercise and Sports Science, diving deep into how movement, nutrition, and discipline can radically transform lives.

            Fitness didnâ€™t just change my body â€” it changed my mindset, my confidence, and my purpose. Now, Iâ€™m here to help others experience that same transformation. Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve helped countless individuals not only transform their bodies, but also reclaim their confidence, strength, and quality of life. My work is backed by a degree in Exercise and Sports Science, and every program I create is grounded in evidence-based science â€” no guesswork, no hype.

            When Iâ€™m not coaching or training, youâ€™ll probably find me out on a hiking trail, deep in a good book, or experimenting in the kitchen â€” cooking up something healthy (or occasionally not ðŸ˜…). I'm also a bit of a stock trading enthusiast, always studying charts and learning the psychology behind the markets.

            Life is about balance â€” and fitness is the foundation that fuels everything else I do.
